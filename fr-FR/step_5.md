## How to solder

Take your components and position them ready for soldering. You want the header to sit flush against the Raspberry Pi Zero as you solder it, and you don't want it to move. I'm going to use a blob of blu tack to keep the components in place so that both of my hands will be free to do the soldering.

Turn on your soldering iron and wait for it to warm up. The tip of the soldering iron will get really hot, so you have to be careful. Make sure that the area where you are soldering is away from other people, small children, and pets - anyone who might trip over the wires or bump into you while you are soldering and cause an accident. It is also a good idea to wear safety goggles and to tie back long hair.

First, make sure that the tip of your soldering iron is clean. Wet the sponge and then wipe the tip on it to clean it. Next, you need to tin the soldering iron by applying a small amount of solder to it. Apply the tinned soldering iron to the area you wish to solder, and introduce the solder stick from the other side. The solder should be sucked in, forming a cone-like shape connecting the pad to the pin. Once you have done one pin, stop and have a look. If your header is wonky, it's a lot easier to correct it now than it will be after you've soldered lots of pins on.

You're aiming for enough solder at the base of the pin to form a good connection. Not enough solder and the connection won't be very good, but too much solder is bad as well.
