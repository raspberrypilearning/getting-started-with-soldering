## Your setup
In this video you will learn how to solder which is a really useful skill for digital makers. Soldering is joining together electronic components by melting a filler metal into the joints.

To start soldering you will need:

- A soldering iron
- Solder
- Desoldering wick
- Components you want to solder together

There are lots of different types of **soldering iron** - different wattages, different nibs and certainly a big difference in price. I would recommend that you would buy a soldering iron from a reputable maker store, within a price range that you can afford.

You will also need some **solder**. Solder comes in two different types - there's leaded solder and lead-free solder. Lead-free solder has a slightly higher melting point, so some people find it more difficult to work with. However, leaded solder obviously contains lead which is a poisonous metal, so you need to be careful about how you handle it.

Regardless of which kind of solder you choose, **the area in which you solder should be very well ventilated**. Here at Pi Towers we have an extractor fan to take away all of the fumes, but you probably don't have one of these at home, so I would advise that you solder in a very well-ventilated area such as a garage or by an open window.

You might want to have some **desoldering wick** handy in case you make a mistake.

And finally you will need the **components** you want to solder together. In this case we're going to show you how to solder a header to a Raspberry Pi Zero.
